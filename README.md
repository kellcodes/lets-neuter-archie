# lets-neuter-archie
A script to fix file permissions in Arch Linux in case you've broken something.  Note that this script is only meant to operate on system files, not the home directory.  Nonetheless, the home directory is fair game.  

The name "archie" refers to a fictional character representing Arch Linux and is not intended to refer to any persons living or dead.

# WARNING
