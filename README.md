# lets-neuter-archie
A script to fix file permissions in Arch Linux in case you've broken something.  Note that this script is only meant to operate on system files, not the home directory.  Nonetheless, the home directory is fair game.  

# WARNING
There is no guarantee that this program will work.  
There is no guarantee that this program will help.
This program MAY make things worse.
Read the bash script (it's pretty short) and make sure you KNOW what it DOES.
